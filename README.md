# Rest Pebble App

Super simple Pebble app for rest intervals (like in the gym or pomodoro)

Originally built by [Remy](https://github.com/remy) for use in the gym, for rest intervals.

There's three simple options and the app includes a configuration screen available from Pebble phone app allowing you to control the rest interval pre-sets.

Features:

- Three timers: Defaults to 60 seconds, 90 seconds, 120 seconds (screen 1)
- Vibrate on timer completion
- When counting down, restarting is mapped to the same buttons, so no extra menus or display required (screen 2)
- Once the timer is complete, an overrun counter starts so if you want a cheeky extra 30 seconds
- Configurable timers
    - Offline config (thanks to Clay)
- Animation free!

If you want to build it yourself, get the SDK from Rebble <http://developer.rebble.io>

Yes, you can also use this for [Pomodoro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)!
